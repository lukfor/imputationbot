# Download Results

The `download` command allows to download all imputed genotypes and the QC report at once:

```
imputationbot download job-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXX
```

If the job is still running, imputation-bot waits until the job is finished and starts automatically with the download.

You can provide imputation-bot the password we sent you via email and it decrypts all files for you:

```
imputationbot download job-XXXXXXXX-XXXXXX-XXX --password MYPASSWORD
```

To download all jobs of a project, we can use the `download` command followed by the project name:

```
imputationbot download my-project
```
